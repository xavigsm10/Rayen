/**
 * Glues [runs] into words, each one keeping its runs as [LyricSyllable]s.
 *
 * Every format that times syllables says which ones belong together the same
 * way, by leaving the space out: Apple's `<span>e</span><span>nough</span>`,
 * an A2 line's `<00:31.83>e<00:31.99>nough `, QQ's `e(31839,157)nough(31996,533)`.
 * A run that neither ends in whitespace nor is followed by a run starting with
 * it is therefore the front of a word that carries on. A blank run — a lone
 * space, or the bare stamp that closes an A2 line — ends the word in hand.
 *
 * Two cases where a missing space says nothing:
 *
 *  - Han, kana and Thai are written without spaces at all, so leaving them out
 *    is not a decision about words. Each run there stays a word of its own, as
 *    it always was; glued, a whole line would become one word and lift as one.
 *  - A writer that puts no whitespace anywhere in the line is not stating word
 *    boundaries either, just omitting them. Each run stays a word, which is
 *    what these lines read as before syllables were looked for at all. Passing
 *    [spacingIsExplicit] says the caller rebuilt the spacing from a flag of its
 *    own, so even a line that is one long split word is believed.
